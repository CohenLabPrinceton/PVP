Funding and Support
===================

Funding and lab space for this project was provided by Princeton University in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Note: See Disclaimer for further details. 

We also wish to thank the <a href="https://www.trevor.org/" title="Trevor Day School of NYC">Trevor Day School of NYC</a> for their generous loan of multiple 3D printers, which greatly contributed to the rapid prototyping efforts of the team. Additional thanks are in order to recognize the indeterminate length of the loan (...no really, thanks for not asking for them back yet).
