Performance
=================

All tests were conducted with a QuickLung standard test lung (IngMar Medical).

Basic Performance
-----------------------


Cough Detection
------------------
A patient-initiated breath after exhalation will result in a momentary drop in PEEP. PVP may optionally detect these transient decreases to trigger a new pressure-controlled breath cycle. We tested this functionality by triggering numerous breaths out of phase with the intended inspiratory cycle, using a QuickTrigger (IngMar Medical) to momentarily open the test lung during PEEP and simulate this transient drop of pressure.

High Pressure Detection

Performance results of the ISO 80601-2-80-2018 pressure controlled vent standard tests with an intended delivered tidal volume of 500 mL.
For each configuration the following parameters are listed: the test number (from the table below), the compliance (C, mL/cm H2O), linear resistance (R, cm H2O/L/s), respiratory frequency (f, breaths/min), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP, cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, cm H2O), and flow adjustment setting.
PIP is reached in every test condition except for case 2, which is approximately 2.4 cm H2O below the set point.
