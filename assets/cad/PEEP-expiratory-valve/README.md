This folder contains CAD files (including Solidworks assembly and part files, STLs, and STEP versions) of the PEEP valve components.

This hardware design is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland). Refer to the text file cern_ohl_v_1_2 or https://ohwr.org/project/licenses/wikis/cern-ohl-v1.2 for details. 

In the event that a commercial PEEP valve cannot be sourced, we provide these 3D printable components so that a user can produce a DIY PEEP version of the valve.

This part may serve either as a traditional PEEP valve in its standard configuration, or as a combined expiratory valve + PEEP valve, by tapping the hole in the cap with a 1/4" NPT tap, and applying pressure to this port. 

We 3D printed the PEEP valve using both ABS and PLA, on a FlashForge and Creality Ender 3 printer, respectively. 

If you are printing the PEEP components, we recommend the following print settings:

- Print at triple vertical shell and 4 horizontal shell. 
- Minimum 40% infill. (We printed ours at 20% in ABS and everything seals well, but higher infill is recommended with PLA).
