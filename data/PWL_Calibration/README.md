This folder contains the Python scripts and data from generation of the PWL dataset, and associated sigmoid curve fitting. 

This calibration enabled us to fit a function to the valve "openness" as a function of flow measured through a Sensirion flow sensor vs. proportional valve duty cycle. 

The calibration was then used to determine a more linear and monotonically increasing relationship between a valve setpoint supplied by the controller and the valve "openness".
