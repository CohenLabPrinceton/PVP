This data was collected by Philippe Bourrianne (Princeton MAE) and processed by Sophie Dvali (Princeton Physics). 

A mass-flow controller (MFC) was set to output varying rates of flow to a D-Lite spirometer (with a differential pressure sensor attached). 
Voltage data was collected from the differential pressure sensor as the flow varied. Pressure readings from the D-Lite were logged as well.
